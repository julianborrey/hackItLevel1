# HackIt - Level 1 #

This is a very small Rails app designed to be hacked for fun.
The app is at [this URL](http://hackitlevel1.projectcaptivate.org).

There are 2 tasks:

1. Change the title of the notice board.
2. Change the currency conversion rate.

The code is in this repo, so if you really want a hint you can look at it 
... but might as well have some fun and try do it first with out looking.

Some hints are in the website anyway.

A good rule of advice is to consider all the resources the website sends 
to you and what resources the website might be using.

Also, to just save you some time, there is no XSS or sanitation breaking in this round.
Probably in level 2 though.

Have fun!
