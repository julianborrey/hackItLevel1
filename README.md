This is a very small Rails app designed to be hacked for fun.

There are 3 tasks:

1. Change the title of the home page.
2. Destroy the currency conversion rate.
3. Make the main page crash each time you access it.

The code is in this repo, so if you really want a hint you can look at it 
... but might as well have some fun and try do it first with out looking. ;)

Also, some hints are in the website anyway.

Have fun!
