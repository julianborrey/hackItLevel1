# HackIt - Level 1 #

This is a very small Rails app designed to be hacked for fun.

There are 2 tasks:

1. Change the title of the notice board.
2. Change the currency conversion rate.

The code is in this repo, so if you really want a hint you can look at it 
... but might as well have some fun and try do it first with out looking. ;)

Some hints are in the website anyway.

Also - to just save you some time, there is no XSS or sanitation breaking in this round.
Probably in level 2 though.

Have fun!
